> [!TIP]
> Specific to this repository:
>
> The `initial` branch has the unmodified files as a starting point for each lab exercise.
>
> The `completed` branch (also the default) has the modified files as the end goal of the exercise.
> 
> (In some cases, I chose to comment rather than delete certain lines which the exercises say to replace.)

> [!NOTE]
> To another time I will likely avoid _git rebasing_ the `completed` branch off of the `initial` branch. As I knew beforehand, this rewrites timestamps and SHA checksums (though checksums are less of an issue on a single-contributor repo).
> 
> The alternative would likely be pull requests (merges) which adds more administrative overhead (PRs, possible merge conflicts). This all for what are to be relatively simple lab exercises and content. :man_shrugging: :face_with_peeking_eye:
